Hello everyone, my name is Leon Lee and I come from China . Many Addon icons may not look very professional, perhaps because developers do not have the cooperation of art or designers. Therefore, I have beautified some preview images of plugins and ICONs myself, hoping to also help other developers:

- Free design: Logo, icon
- No signature required: Leon Lee (涛哥)
- No need to mention: My website www.bgteach.com
- Email contact: @litao@bgetach.com

I am not a developer, so I cannot directly provide development. Please contact me and provide a simple ICON so that I can quickly understand the design intent. Welcome everyone to come and cooperate with me
